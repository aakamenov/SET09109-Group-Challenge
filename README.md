# SET09109 Fundamentals of Parallel Systems
## Group Challenge - Pairs Game
### The Challenge
> The challenge is to modify the game implementation so that players have to take it in turn to expose
> squares and all players can see the squares that have been exposed. If a player exposes a pair they can
> continue with their turn by exposing more squares. A playerâ€™s turn ceases as soon as they expose two
> squares that do not match.
